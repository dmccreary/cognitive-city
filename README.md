# Cognitive City

What if your city had a "brain"?  It could monitor everything happening in the city
and help the citizens achieve their goals.

Traditional RDBMS systems are too brittle to model the complex relationships in a smart city.  But graph databases are able to solve the most complex ananlytical challenges.

This repo contains some knowledge graph models for cities that can think.

## Build Instructions

* mkdocs material for documentation
* TigerGraph for the graph database
* PyTigerGraph for the load and query
